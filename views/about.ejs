    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Moustafa Ahmed Hesham. I’m a passionate FC Barcelona supporter and I built this site as a way to share and celebrate everything related to our beloved club. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, you’ll find the latest news, analysis, and updates about Barça — from match results and player performances to behind-the-scenes stories. My goal is to create a space where fellow culers can stay up-to-date and enjoy all things Barcelona in one place. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This site was created in <strong>2025</strong>, born out of both my love for football and my desire to practice web development by blending creativity with my passion for Barça.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re here to read match reports, discover insights, or just feel the spirit of the Blaugrana family, I hope you enjoy your time here. Visca el Barça!
